# CampaignApp

I want to be able to create, edit or delete a separate campaign for each of my products I want to sell

Sellers to enter the following information for each campaign:

• Campaign name (mandatory)

• Keywords (mandatory, pre-populated with typeahead)

• Bid amount (mandatory, min amount )

• Campaign fund (mandatory and deducted from their Emerald account 
funds, new balance updated on screen

• Status (on or off - mandatory)

• Town (can pick from pre-populated 

dropdown list of towns)

• Radius (mandatory in kilometres)


//Comment

Double validation was performed on F-E and on B-E,
the budget is updated after removing, adding or editing the campaign,
the possibility of sorting the table has also been added,
At the beginning, 3 campaigns are added, but the money can be safely returned to the budget.
